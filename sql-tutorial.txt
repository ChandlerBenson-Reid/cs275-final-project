Instructions on setting up MySQL database the first time

Connect to MySQL in whichever way works best for you.
On *nix machines, its usually
> mysql start
> mysql -u root -p
> <Enter Password>
You should now be in a terminal window that interfaces with MySQL

Create the Database, set it as the current active database
> create database access;
> use access;

The next part can be done in two ways. access.sql is set up so that on every use,
it wipes the database clean and builds it from scratch. This way we can add and remove test and demo data very easily.
However, you will see an error if the "drop table" statements happen before the table is created in the database.

1. Alter the access.sql file
    Comment out the "drop table" statements in access.sql
    Run the .sql file import

2. Create the tables in MySQL with minimal information, so that on the first run, access.sql drops tables that do exist
    > create table Organizations (
        > name varchar(64) primary key
        > );
    create table Users (
        > name varchar(64) primary key
        > );
    create table Content (
        > name varchar(64) primary key
        > );

The information that goes into the tables on first creation does not matter at all.
They just need minimum one row to be a valid MySQL table.
If you wanted to, you could copy and paste the create table statements from access.sql and it would get the same thing done

Now import access.sql into your access database
> source /path/to/access.sql
If you are in the cs275-final-project directory, you can simply type
> source access.sql

Whenever a change needs to be made to the database, add it to the access.sql file, and re-import the database.
Re-importing the database will only be running the following command with an updated access.sql file
> source access.sql
